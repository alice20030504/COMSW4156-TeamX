# Style and Static Analysis Summary

## Toolchain
- **Checkstyle 10.12.5** driven by `checkstyle.xml` (Google Java Style base).
- **mvn checkstyle:check** is our primary verification command; it runs during the Maven `verify` phase.
- **IDE formatter**: IntelliJ IDEA using the Google Java code style profile.

## Key Rules
- Enforced naming conventions for classes, methods, and constants.
- Required Javadoc on public types and methods.
- Limited method complexity and nesting depth.
- Verified brace placement and indentation consistency.
- Flagged unused imports, dead code, and overly broad exception handling.

## Current Status
- Latest run (`mvn clean checkstyle:check`) reports zero violations for the `iteration-1` submission.
- Checkstyle report archived at `reports/checkstyle-result.xml` for reference.
- Formatting hooks execute before commit to keep diffs minimal and consistent.
- PMD is disabled for iteration 1 and will be revisited in iteration 2.

## Planned Improvements
- Add a custom Checkstyle rule to enforce `@DisplayName` usage in JUnit tests.
- Explore automated linting for YAML and Markdown to align configuration and documentation formatting.
