### 2. Bug Fixes

#### Bug Fix #1: Database Initialization Error

**Component**: `src/main/resources/data.sql`
**AI Tool**: Claude Code
**Extent of AI Involvement**: High (90% AI-generated)

**Problem Identified**:
```
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLSyntaxErrorException: Table "EXERCISES" not found
```

**AI Prompts**:
- "Fix the error as I run mvn spring-boot:run [error output]"
- "The application is trying to insert data into an `exercises` table that doesn't exist"

**AI-Generated Solution**:
- Analyzed `data.sql` file
- Identified mismatched table names (data.sql referenced tables with no JPA entities)
- Commented out INSERT statements for non-existent entities
- Added TODO markers for future entity implementation
- Added sample data for existing `persons_simple` table

**Code Changes** (data.sql):
```sql
-- Before (AI found this issue)
INSERT INTO exercises (...) VALUES (...);  -- Table doesn't exist!

-- After (AI-generated fix)
-- TODO: Uncomment when Exercise entity is created
-- INSERT INTO exercises (...) VALUES (...);

-- AI added this:
INSERT INTO persons_simple (name, birth_date, weight, height)
VALUES
    ('John Smith', '1990-05-15', 80.5, 180),
    ('Sarah Johnson', '1995-08-22', 65.0, 165),
    ('Mike Chen', '1988-03-10', 75.0, 175);
```

**Human Review**: Verified the fix worked, approved the solution.

#### Bug Fix #2: 404 Error on Root URL

**Component**: `src/main/java/com/teamx/fitness/controller/HomeController.java`
**AI Tool**: Claude Code
**Extent of AI Involvement**: High (100% AI-generated)

**Problem Identified**:
```
Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.
```

**AI Prompt**:
- "I started running but this is what I got in the front end: [screenshot of 404 error]"

**AI Analysis**:
- Diagnosed that no controller handled root URL (`/`)
- All endpoints were under `/api/*`
- User expected landing page at root

**AI-Generated Solution**:
Created `HomeController.java`:
```java
package com.teamx.fitness.controller;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView;

/**
 * Controller for handling the root URL and providing navigation.
 */
@Controller
public class HomeController {

    /**
     * Redirect root URL to Swagger UI for API documentation.
     *
     * @return redirect to Swagger UI
     */
    @GetMapping("/")
    public RedirectView home() {
        return new RedirectView("/swagger-ui.html");
    }
}
```

**Human Review**: Tested the fix, confirmed it works as expected.

### 3. Code Analysis and Recommendations

**Component**: General code review
**AI Tool**: Claude Code
**Extent of AI Involvement**: Advisory only

**AI Prompts**:
- "Tell me how I can test and run this repo"
- "Explain what the Swagger UI interface is and why it looks like this"

**AI Assistance**:
- Analyzed project structure
- Identified technology stack (Spring Boot, Maven, H2)
- Explained RESTful API architecture vs traditional web app
- Provided guidance on running, testing, and using the application
- Explained Swagger UI purpose and usage

**Human Review**: Used AI explanations to understand project better and create documentation.

## Code NOT Generated by AI

The following code was written entirely by human team members without AI assistance:

### Core Application Code

1. **FitnessManagementApplication.java**
   - Spring Boot main application class
   - Entirely human-written

2. **PersonController.java**
   - Fitness calculation endpoints (BMI, age, calories)
   - All business logic human-designed
   - AI only helped with documentation comments

3. **ResearchController.java**
   - Research data endpoints
   - Mock data generation logic human-created
   - AI only helped with documentation

4. **PersonService.java**
   - BMI calculation formulas
   - BMR calculation (Mifflin-St Jeor equation)
   - TDEE calculation
   - Age calculation
   - All algorithms human-implemented

5. **Data Models** (PersonSimple.java, ApiLog.java)
   - JPA entity design entirely human-created
   - Field selection and validation rules human-decided

6. **Configuration Files**
   - `pom.xml` - Human-created Maven configuration
   - `application.yml` - Human-created Spring configuration
   - `checkstyle.xml` - Human-adapted from Google Java Style Guide
