# CI Reports Directory

This directory contains automated code quality and test reports generated by the CI pipeline.

## Report Structure

- `checkstyle/` - Code style analysis reports (Checkstyle)
- `pmd/` - Static code analysis reports (PMD)
- `test/` - Unit and integration test results
- `coverage/` - Code coverage reports (JaCoCo)
- `ci-summary.md` - Summary of CI pipeline execution

## How Reports Are Generated

### Automated (GitHub Actions)

Reports are automatically generated on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the CI pipeline configuration.

### Local Generation

Run the local CI script to generate reports:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/ci-local.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\scripts\ci-local.ps1
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report checkstyle:checkstyle pmd:check
```

## Viewing Reports

- **PMD**: Open `pmd/pmd.html` in a web browser
- **Coverage**: Open `coverage/index.html` in a web browser
- **Test Results**: See `test/surefire-reports/` for detailed test output

## Note

This directory is tracked in git to preserve CI report history. Generated reports are updated by the CI pipeline.
